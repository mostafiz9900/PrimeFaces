                    <p>"We must reveal the framework at an appropriate time so that the next general election is held in a free, fair and inclusive manner," Fakhrul said while talking to reporters at a function at the party's Nayapaltan central office in Dhaka this noon.
                        About the government's denial of holding talks to reach a mutual compromise over the impasse of the polls-time management, Fakhrul said Awami League is scraping the issue sensing its absolute failure in the upcoming national polls. Rejecting BNP's plea of holding the talks, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on January 12, in her speech to the nation, said the 11th parliamentary next general election would be held in line with constitutional provisions, meaning she would be holding office as the head of the government during the polls.

                        "We want a neutral polls-time government. We don't want any administration under the Sheikh Hasina-led government as we know no fair and credible election can be held under them (AL)," he said.

                        "The government is neither paying heeds to our demand nor walking through the path of talks," Fakhrul said adding that the ruling Awami League will face an absolute debacle if people can exercise their voting rights in the election in a smooth atmosphere.</p>
